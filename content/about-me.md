# Who Am I?
### Hello.
My name is **Cameron Wang** (Student ID: 13202320), and I am currently a 2nd Year Student studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Diploma in Engineering Practice degree at University of Technology Sydney (UTS).
As for my future career, I currently aspire to break into the field of IT and Engineering, working as a software engineer to develop reliable, efficient, secure and high-quality software systems.

# My Current Level of Understanding on the Topic
As of starting the summer studio, my understanding on cyber security was extremely limited. I have knowledge on very basic and beginner aspects of security, through my participations of Capture The Flags (CTFs) and 
through my own research.

# Summer Studio 2019
 - ## The Purpose of my Summer Studio
	I have chosen to undergo the Cyber Security: An Offensive Mindset studio, with the main outcome being to learn and grow the skills necessary in those working in the industry.

 - ## Why I Have Chosen This Studio
	Even though I am primarily focused in software development and programming, I have always been interestied towards anything technology related. As such, one of these fields that I wish to learn and understand more about
	is the field of Cyber Security. I have taken the opportunity to work in this studio in hopes to grow my skills, learning and understanding.

	Although participation in this studio does not align with my overall career goals, I believe it would be beneficial to develop skills in this field, especially working within the field of IT. I may also be able
	to incorporate my skills in software with my interest towards cyber security.

	As a result of the way cyber studios are designed and run, collaboration and presentations are two important factors studied and practiced upon. I have taken this opportunity to further develop my skills in communication,
	teamwork and planning, and public speaking.
