# Sprint Reflection

The second week of the subject has been a much more intense experience than the first, however, it has been an important and enriching experience learning, understanding and practicing
web application security.

The main focus of the second sprint was **Web Application Security**. Our task required us to pose a problem statement, looking into the various types of vulnerabilities in relation to the problem, and discussing the effects and importance of web application security
by demonstrating the exploits in practice. Due to the mass use of the Internet, and web applications by millions of people, my problem statement focused on the importance of learning and understanding web application security to ensure the security
and integrity of user data. As to demonstrate my statement, throughout the week, I took advantage of the various resources online to develop my own learning and understanding of the many types of web vulnerabilities, the technical and detailed workings
behind each vulnerability through readings and practical exercises, and the severe and devastating effects these issues can cause when not properly considered during development. PentesterLab's Web for Pentester online course, and ShellterLab provided long,
detailed and informative readings on web systems, web application and web vulnerabilities, along with providing practical exercises and challenges which applies the learning in a controlled practical setting. HackerOne's Hacker101 CTF and OverTheWire: Natas wargame
helped reinforce my studies on web application penetration learnt from the readings by providing challenges in the form of games, tasking players to locate a flag or password to earn points or progress onto further levels using their understanding of security
on intentionally vulnerable web applications. I had also tried applying the skills and knowledge gained throughout the week on bug bounties, testing vulnerable, real world web applications through Bugcrowd and HackerOne, however, I was unable to discover any
issues. Despite failing to successfully penetrate any real world web application, the experience was still valuable, understanding that I must continue to research and study to further grow my skills and knowledge.

On Friday (15/02/2019), we were required to present out problem statement, our evidence of web vulnerabilities through practical web penetration of vulnerable web applications, and the effects of web security to businesses, with methods to mitigate issues, to the tutors
and the class. According to Larry Zektser's feedback on my presentation, eye contact was good, but could definitely be improved, which can be acheived in future presentation with proper time management and preparation of the content.

Rather than the usual scrum meetings, where each member describes their progress, their challenges, and what they hope to achieve in the future to all other memebers, we have instead begun to do **Free-for-Alls**, where members are split into small groups, and discusses
their progress, their challenges, and what they hope to achieve through conversation. Free-for-Alls, for me, help provide a means to socialise, to develop my connections with each of my peers through more direct, face-to-face conversations. The Friday (15/02/2019) Free-for-All
was definitely an insightful experience. Having much more direct conversations allowed each other to assist with the challenges we were facing, teaching each other about anything we had learned. I had learnt more about clickjacking and iframe exploits, and the OWASP ZAP tool,
discovering its functionality and importance to web penetration testing, whilst also getting to know some of my classmates.

On Monday (11/02/2019), Luke Fuehrer, Security Intern at Sense of Security, gave an in-depth presentation on the mindset of ethical hackers, teaching the attack vectors that should be looked for when penetrating web applications and provided detailed insight on what it means to be
an ethical hacker in the industry. Luke also went into great detail on background information relating to web systems and web penetration tools and exploitable vulnerabilities. Luke gave a second presentation on Wednesday (13/02/2019), focusing more towards the evolution and history
of the Internet, web applications, and Cross Site Scripting (XSS). As someone who is still learning, new to the field of cyber security, Luke definitely provided great starting points on what tools and areas of web systems I should be studying, and more importantly, the mindset I must
possess when penetration testing.

According to feedbacks received from my previous sprint submission, posting blog posts of work on CTF challenges and Wargames I attempt during the subject would be beneficial. I have begun to upload write-ups of every CTF or Wargame I participate in, listing out exploit used in the challenge,
and describing the steps I took to complete the task. The write-ups will continue to be updated as I continue to progress.

One of the biggest challenges I am still currently facing is working with my GitHub repository to store my portfolio contents. Currently, working on my posts locally is not an option as the git commands will not allow me to properly push my changes onto my repository. Any changes made needs to be edited directly onto the content stored in the repository, while any local changes needs to be dragged and dropped into the repository.
