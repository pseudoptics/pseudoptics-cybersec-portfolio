# Group Reflection

One of the most important aspects when working in the industry is teamwork. For the duration of the summer studio, to emulate the real industry workplace, we are all placed into groups and are required
to work together to achieve a goal or result. In the industry of cyber security, groups are working together to break into systems and software, discovering and documenting exploitable vulnerabilities, 
and consulting system owners for ways to mitigate those vulnerabilities.

## What Have We Achieved?

For this first week, the groups were tasked with a research project, to develop and present a presentation on any topic of interest relating to security. For our group, we focused on the RSA SecurID system 
breach in 2011, where the two factor authentication device SecurID was breached, and sensitive data was stolen.

## What Have We Learned?

Through the progress of this task, our group has been able to develop many skills, both relating to the topic of cyber security, as well as the ability to properly work as a team, communicate and research. We 
were also able to develop our problem solving skills when we were forced to re-revaluate our project plan after one of our group members left the subject, requiring a change in planning and work distribution.

## What Do We Need To Do Next?

At this current stage of the subject, we should focus on progressing with our research and learning from this week’s project. We should continue to further research and learn more about the inner workings of 
exploitable vulnerabilities and attackers’ methodologies and approaches when attacking. We should begin to deepen and reinforce our understanding through practice, by participating in practical challenges such 
as Capture The Flags (CTFs) and wargames.
