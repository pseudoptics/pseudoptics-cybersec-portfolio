# Sprint Reflection

The final week of the Summer Studio. It has been an intense, but insightful journey through the world of cyber security. The final week put all of our skills developed throughout the subject to the test;
gaining root on an active Hack The Box machine, whilst also teaching the standard vulnenrability documentation by reporting our process using the given format.

The main focus of the final week was **Applying Our Skills and Knowledge to the Test**. A continuation of the task given in the previous week, locating and exploiting vulnerabilities to gain root on vulnerable
machines, targeting active Hack The Box machines rather than standard boot2root virtual machines. Due to the Terms of Service of Hack The Box, users are forbidden to produce solutions or write-ups for any active
machine or challenge, making the active machines the perfect tests to demonstrate my skills and knowledge developed throughout the subject. Before I was able to work on active Hack The Box machines, I needed
an account on their platform, which required me to receive an invitation code only obtainable by *hacking* their invitation process and generating an invitation code for myself. On Wednesday (27/02/2019), I was
finally able to generate an invitation code and create an account on their platform, managing to complete the majority of the challenge without any assistance. I did, however, require a hint at one particular section
to progress further with the challenge, but the help has taught me more about the workings of \<REDACTED> programming, and the utilization of the command line tool \<REDACTED>. Due to the Terms of Service of the platform,
I am unabale to go into further detail on my experiences  in solving the invitation code generation. The active machine I chose to attack was the **Curling** machine, an easy difficulty challenge. Hacking is about the mindset, 
being able to locate the attack vectors and exploit the vulerabilities to gain user and root privileges, and practicing through actively attacking machines helps develop my skills in analysing and problem solving.

An important aspect of a security professional's work is reporting and documenting vulnerabilities, exploits and breaches. To practice and prepare for real-world security documentation, a template was provided, requiring a
detailed explanation of the objective, process and the tools and exploits used to complete the objective. Using the template, I documented my process towards gaining root on the **Curling** Hack The Box machine akin to the levels
of detail of a report conducted by a security professional. Due to the Terms of Service of the platform, I am unable to provide the report providing the details towards gaining root on the machine, as it is still active as of
writing this post.

Both the process to generating the invitation code and the report have been privately sent to the tutors of my subject as artefacts of my work, but will not be shared on my portfolio until the box has been retired.

Apart from the main focus of the week, I spent part of my time working on my presentation for the Friday (01/03/2019) Expo, where students from all Summer Studios present their final projects, learning process, highlights and
lowlights to the university, industry partners and other students. Although my presentation briefly presents my work throughout the subject, I focused the majority of my presentation on a demonstration of the Kioptrix Level 1 
boot2root challenge, as I felt it would be the best and most interesting way in showcasing the audience of my learning through hacking a machine live and explaining each step in the process. Although it was daunting to present
to industry partners and students from other studios, compared to the usual smaller community developed in my own studio, it was definitely an important and enriching experience to be able to showcase my knowledge and skills I worked
hard developing throughout the subject.

On Monday (25/02/2019), Ruben, an Application Security professional, visited the studio with practical reverse engineering exercises and challenges, rather than the traditional presentation format from the other industry visits.
As a Software Engineer and Programmer, it was an interesting and enjoyable experience to learn the fundamentals of Assembly Language, and the process of analyzing assembly code to gain an understanding of the functionality of the program
and retrieve the flag.
