# Ethical Hacking

## Statement on Ethical Hacking and it's Importance to Stakeholders
Ethical Hacking, also referred to as White Hat, is an important aspect in the field of Cyber Security. 
For stakeholders, it is important for their systems and applications to be as secured from any exploits or vulnerabilities as possible. 
However, no system is ever completely secure, and people will always find exploits and vulnerabilities. 
It is now  Ethical Hacking first began as a philosophy in hacking culture, where those who practiced hacker ethic acknowledged the fact that sharing information and data responsibly was beneficial and helpful. 
However, it has now since become a profession where security experts attempt to penetrate systems, networks, applications and other computer resources, with legal permission from the stakeholder, to locate vulnerabilities and issues that could be exploited.

Stakeholders must understand the importance of ethical hacking and its relation to developing a much more secured system or application. 
The best way to determine the level of protection of the stakeholder is to purposely attack and locate vulnerabilities and issues themselves, which can then be fixed before others can utilize those exploits for malicious purposes. 
Many companies and organizations have adopted this mentality of utilizing ethical hacking in building the security of their systems through bug bounties, providing incentives, for any discoveries which are privately disclosed (known as responsible disclosure).

## What is Responsible Disclosure?
**Responsible Disclosure** is a vulnerability disclosure policy stating that any vulnerability or issue discovered in an application or website should be privately disclosed within a certain period of time from the discovery to ensure that the vulnerability is patched and resolved. 
As issues require time to locate and resolve, it is important to disclose the vulnerability around the same time as the discovery to limit the amount of damage it may potentially cause.

Responsible Disclosures are always conducted in private, as a publicized statement of the issue is considered as a **Full Disclosure**, which are usually done in cases where:
- Contact cannot be made with the company.
- The vulnerability report was ignored.
- The vulnerability was not fixed.
- Notifying the public may prompt a fix by the company.
- Are afraid of legal prosecution.

Full Disclosures help warn the public of the unfixed issue, and places pressure on the company to act.

## Bug Bounties
Bug Bounties are incentivized vulnerability disclosure programs, where individuals or teams are rewarded, usually monetarily, and recognized for discovering and reporting bugs and vulnerabilities.

Many companies, such as Facebook, Google, Mozilla, and Reddit, reward large amounts of money depending on the severity of the vulnerability, and security platforms such as Bugcrowd and HackerOne provide services and a community for security experts to manage their bug bounty, vulnerability disclosures, and penetration testing programs.

## Implementing Learning to Test Web Applications Under Responsible Disclosure

The end goal of the second sprint is to undergo research on Web App Security, the different forms of exploits, and use our understanding of the topic to penetrate multiple web applications (legally / with consent). As part of the responsible disclosure policy, any vulnerabilities I discover during my penetration testing will be privately disclosed to the application's developers.
