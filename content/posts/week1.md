# Sprint Reflection

Due to my inexperience and lack of knowledge in the cyber security field, the first week of the summer studio has been an enriching learning 
experience. 

---

The main task was to research and create a presentation on any topic relating to the security, which provided the opportunity 
to grow and develop our knowledge and understanding. Focusing on the 2011 RSA SecurID Breach, conducting research on major security 
attacks allowed me to develop an understanding of the technical details and workings of the exploits and methods that are utilised, whilst 
listening to the other presentations helped further enhance my knowledge, with other groups discussing topics of other attacks and exploits in 
great detail. In the field of IT and Cyber Security, it is important to continuously research to stay up-to-date, as technology contninues to grow 
and advance.

Throughout the week, I have been researching and experiementing static websites, which contain webpages that always displays fixed content to all users
without requiring knowledge on web programming and database design and management. All tasks, projects and progress completed is required to be documented 
into a portfolio for the subject, so as a means to understand websites, web applications and web services, my portfolio is presented through my website.

My portfolio has been created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go, and themed using the *terminal* theme by author [panr](https://radoslawkoziel.pl/),
with all web page content written using Markdown. The files are hosted in my [github repository](https://github.com/pseudoptics/pseudoptics.github.io) and is deployed using 
Netlify.

Although the process from learning to publishing has been a interesting and enjoyable experience, the development of my static website has been long and difficult.
My biggest struggle during development was working with my github repository to host my files. I had never used git before this project, so understanding how to push 
and pull my projects to update my repository was challenging.

Hopefully, as I progress through the development of my website and grow my understanding of web development and Git, I will be able to apply my knowledge into future projects.

On Wednesday (06/02/2019), GitLab Security Engineer Robert Mitchell visited the class and gave a presentation discussing background information on the various topics and fields of cyber security,
and providing meaningful advice on the areas of study to help break into the industry. Due to my inexperience in the field, his two hour presentation had been extremely informative and insightful, 
helping me develop my skills, knowledge and experience to soon find a future career.
