# Conclusion
As stated in my introduction, I began the subject with very beginner and limited knowledge or practical experience in cyber security, beyond the few CTFs I had participated out of interest, and the preparation work that was provided to students
before the subject began. My main goal I hoped to achieve by the end of the subject was a development in my skills and knowledge on the topic of cyber security, and the work and projects tasked to me throughout the four weeks of the summer studio 
has definitely allowed me to reach my goal. My studies throughout the subject have deepened my knowledge and understanding of security concepts through the research and presentation tasks, taught me the methodologies of penetration testing through 
the practical CTFs and vulnerable web applications and VMs, and an understanding of the industry throgh presentations from security professionals in the industry, with the development of my own personal skill sets, writing, presenting and leadership,
through the constant and helpful feedback from my tutors.

---
Working through the Cyber Security Summer Studio has been an intense experience. Learning, understanding and applying our knowledge of the concepts and methodologies of cyber security in a span of four weeks is a difficult and
daunting task. However, it is definitely an experience I personally do not regret, as stressful as it was. I have always had an interest in the field of cyber security, wanting to possibly persue it as a career option. I conducted
my own research, joined the UTS Cyber Security Society, and participated in Capture The Flag (CTFs) competitions to learn and develop my knowledge and skills, however, my time constraints from uni studies and personal life hasn't allowed 
me to continue my hobby. What drew interest towards the summer studio was the hopes I could continue to grow my skills and knowledge without distractions. Beginning the subject with little to no experience in the cyber security field, 
as I work through the research tasks, listen to security professionals from the industry discussing a range of topics on security, and applying my learnt skills in a practical environment, breaking into vulnerable web applications and virtual 
machines, my knowledge on security topics has grown, and my skills have been developed.

Part of the learning process throughout the Summer Studio subject are the SLOs, the Subject Learning Objectives, that each student is required to meet.

## SLO 1 - Engage with Stakeholders to Identify a Problem
Throughout the subject, security professionals from the industry came to visit the class to teach us on topics relating to security topics and inform us of the industry. Their visits have provided me with an understanding on security and the industry as
a whole.

Understanding the fundamental concepts of security is vital to further progressing as a security professional. Especially as someone who has a very small background in security, knowing the basics is valuable towards development. For the first week
of the subject, Robert Mitchell, a security professional from the industry, appeared for the class to provide a presentation on the fundamentals of security, the aspects to study to break into the industry, and the mindset that a security specialist
must have to protect against attacks.

Mindset is extremely important for a cyber security professional. Understanding how to approach an application or system is essential for locating vulnerabilities. For the second week, alongside learning about web application penetration testing, 
Luke Fuehrer, a security intern from Sense of Security, gave a presentation discussing the mindset of an ethical hacker, discussing in great detail on what it means to be an ethical hacker, and the attack vectors to look out for while penetration testing,
including the tools and exploitable vulnerabilities. He presented a second time in the week, instead focusing more on the history of web applications and the Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

It is important to understand the field of work that a person wishes to persue as a career. The cyber security industry encompasses multiple professions, and it's important to understand the roles that each play. For the third week, three members from
Deloitte's security team, Viren, Simon and Nathan, visited to present a detailed overview on the Cyber Security industry, specifically focusing on Red Teaming, professionals who test the security of an organisation by actively attacking their systems and
locations. The team informed the class of Red Teams, how they differ from traditional penetration testers, and the types of tools and methodologies used when red teaming, using their own experiences on the job as examples of the work Red Teams perform.

As many professionals in cyber security focus on skills that support penetration testing of web applications or systems, Reverse Engineering is a skillset that is severely overlooked. As a software engineer myself, being able to work backwards on a
program is a necessary skillset for me to understand. For the fourth week, Ruben, an Application Security professional, arrived with practical reverse engineering exercises and challenges, rather than the traditional presentations from the other industry
visits. Through multiple challenges, increasing in difficulty, Ruben teaches the fundamentals of Assembly Language, and the process of analyzing assembly code to understand the inner working of software and retrieve the flags.

## SLO 2 - Apply Design Thinking To Respond To A Defined Or Newly Identified Problem
Understanding the theory behind security vulnerabilities and exploits is important for security professionals, however, it is equally as important be able to apply skills in a practical manner, breaking into vulnerable web applications and systems to resolve
those vulnerabilities.

Alongside security research tasks and presentations, through attacking purposefully vulnerable web applications and virtual machines, the subject allows me to develop and apply my studies and skills through practical exercises.

With the World Wide Web being a popular and important resource in the modern age, stakeholders must ensure that websites and web applications are properly secured to protect the integrity and security of sensitive user data. Week 2 focused on practical
Web Application Security, where alongside research on the field, I was tasked to demonstrate my research through practice against vulnerable web applications. Taking advantage of the multitude of free resources online, I developed my skills and 
understanding of web application security, learning the many types of web vulnerabilities, the technical and detailed workings of each vulnerability through reading resources and practical exercises, and the severe reprocussions of these exploits if not properly
considered and fixed. PentesterLab's Web for Pentester course, and ShellterLabs provide in-depth information and readings on web systems and their vulnerabilities, while providing controlled practical exercises and environments to apply my learning. OverTheWire Natas
wargame and HackerOne's Hacker101 CTF are challenges that focus on applying web application security to locate flags or passwords to earn points or progress, helping reinforce my previous studies. I had also attempted Bug Bounties, testing my skills and studies on real
world web applications, in-scope and with permission from the owners, however, I was unable to locate any issues.

Stakeholders must ensure that their systems remain up-to-date and secured. Once an attacker gains root privileges on a vulnerable machine, they gain complete access and control of the machine. Week 3 focused on understanding the attack vectors, vulnernabilities and mindset
when attacking vulnerable machines, demonstrated through boot2root virtual machines. boot2root machines are purposefully vulnerable virtual machines designed for attackers to attempt to gain root. As I am still a beginner, the machines I focused on were leveled for beginners,
allowing me to continue developing my skills through practice. The Kioptrix Level 1 machine, which I have managed to gain root privileges on, and the pwnlab_init machine, were the two manchines I worked through. Working through the boot2root exercises not only provided a lot 
of experience and knowledge of the mindset and tools used in penetration testing machines, but understanding and networking virtual machines.

As a secondary option to the boot2root machines, I was given permission by Shaun, the owner of apointb, to penetration test his web applications, which are real world web applications. I had attempted to penetrate his applications, scanning directories and performing XSS and SQL Injections,
but I was unable to locate any vulnerabilities.

Week 4 was a continuation of the previous week, attacking active Hack The Box machines rather than standard boot2root virtual machines. As the platform's Terms of Service forbids users from posting any write-ups or solutions for their active machines, this exercise provides a difficult challenge,
testing my skills. Before I was able to try an active box, I first needed to register an account, which requires me to gain an invitation code through hacking their system and generating one myself. The machine I have been working through is the Curling machine, which has been a challenging, yet very
insightful experience. However, following the platform's Terms of Service, I am unable to post any write-ups of my process with both the Invitation Code Generation and the Help machine. The artefacts, however, have been privately sent to the tutors of the subject.

## SLO 3 - Apply Technical Skills To Develop, Model and/or Evaluate Design
Researching and understanding the workings of security vulnerabilities and exploits is important for security professionals. Knowing the inner workings of vulerabilities and exploits at a technical level enables professionals to test real world systems and
web applications for those vulnerabilities, and more importantly, mitigate the effects of the vulnerability when exploited, or patch the vulnerability completely.

Reading and researching into past security breaches and attacks help better shape security in future systems. Understanding the vulnerabilities, exploits and methods undertaken by attackers forms the implementation of security measures to protect against similar attacks.
I was tasked, as part of a group, to conduct research on a security topic of interest for the first week of the subject. My group looked into the 2011 RSA SecurID Data Breach, where the security company RSA had their two-factor authentication system SecurID breached, with
sensitive data stolen. Conducting researching on major security attacks allowed me to develop an understanding of the technical details and working of exploits and methods that are utilised in attacks.

In week 2, alongside practical demonstrations of web application vulnerabilities and exploits, I conducted research to help me understand these vulnerabilities and exploits in detail. PentesterLab's Web for Pentester and ShellterLab, aside from their practical environment to
learn and test web application vulnerbailities through practice, provide long and detailed courses explaining web systems, web applications and web vulnerablities.

It is important for a security professional to understand the inner workings of the tools. Alongside the boot2root challenges, week 3 also had me, in a group, conduct researach on a security tool or multiple tools in detail, to learn and understand more on their purpose, applications
and how it functions in detail. My group decided to focus on Password Cracking tools, specifically looking into John The Ripper and Hashcat, teaching me more about passwords, how passwords are stored and encrypted, and how these tools break it at a technical level.

## SLO 4 - Demonstrate Effective Collaboration and Communication Skills
In the field of cyber security, teamwork is a vital skill for security professionals. Professionals work in teams in real world tasks and projects, so leadership, communication and collaboration skills is necessary to develop.

There were many tasks which required me to form groups to accomplish throughout the subject; however, the nature of learning cyber security meant that much of the work was individual. Instead, the subject more heavily focused on communication skills through constant
presentations and free-for-all sessions every week.

A multitude of online services were utilised during group tasks to ensure proper communication and collaboration was established. Microsoft Teams and Messenger were the main communication channels used to communicate between each member, while implementing
Microsoft Planner into the Microsoft Teams group allowed proper task management for each member of the group. Google Docs and Google Slides are online services that me and my groups utilised to version control and collaborate live on our tasks, being able to see the changes
made by each member of the group.

Each week, I was required to present as part of the work I was tasked with. The first week was a group presentation, where my group and I were to present on a security topic of our choice, which we chose the RSA SecurID Data Breach. The second week was individual, where I 
posed a problem statement, and presented my learning on web application vulnerabilities at a high level, simulating real world professionals with stakeholders. The third week was a group presentation, where my group and I researched a security tool, and presented a high
level presentation discussing the applications of the tool with examples provided to demonstrate. The final week was the Expo, where I, as an individual, presented my learning and skills developed throughout the course of the subject to the university, industry partners, and 
students from the other studios. Each presentation task helped boost my confidence and skills in public speaking and presenting.

Rather than the standard Scrum meetings to begin and end off each week of the subject, instead we had free-for-all sessions, where at the start of each day, we would get into small groups and have more direct conversations on what we have done, what we have learnt, and what we plan
to continue learning, while learning from other students and their experiences.

## SLO 5 - Conduct Critical Self and Peer Review and Performance Evaluation
It is important to strive for success, however, mistakes are an important step towards achieving success. Throughout the subject, I ensured that I continuously received feedback for all my tasks as a means to continue developing and perfecting my skills.

At the end of each week, the tutors of the class conduct one-on-one sessions, where they discuss on feedback for the tasks and show areas to improve. Attending the one-on-ones allows me to understand where I stand in the subject and how my weekly work could
be improved for future tasks. Each sprint submission receives feedback by one of the tutors through UTSOnline, helping me continuously improve on my future portfolio submissions.
